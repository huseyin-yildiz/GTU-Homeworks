I made this part of the hw is using shift-reduce parsing algorithm as shown as class. But Because of some my special problems i couldnt complete exactly the the rest of the lisp part of the hw. I hold the kw-val pairs as object in lists and implement stack and shifting and also reducing. with this program we can make it for other languages also just by changing the production rules and value returns of that rule like yacc. As i said i couldnt complete some value calculations to return a result. But its not diffrent than the algorithm i used in yacc side. I completed yacc side. If i had some more time i would convert same algorithm i used in yacc side to lisp. But i had some problems. I had no time. I tried to do best. Sorry for that sir. Please review my code and give me points according to the code. Because actually hard side of it completed. There are just production rules sorting according to presedence and calculations of returning values. Sorry again. Thank you for understanding.
